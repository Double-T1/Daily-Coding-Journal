Learned and pracitced some BST, 2 leetcode questions done, was a lot harder than i thought it would be.
MIT intro to algo is god sent resource. So richful yet so succinct.
Also learned and praciticed 2 prefix sum questions with DS of matrix. It wasn't hard, but required some learning process.
Overall, could be more efficient, but made some progress today no doubt.
