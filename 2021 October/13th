finished 8 new leetcode challenges
first i practiced two backtracking problems. Combination sum, which is one of them, was relatively easy. The other one, Lower Case permutation, required some googling to get it done.
unfortunaly, my third try on Permutation II failed. Might challenge it again tomorrow
Then i had two DP problems. Both were dealt with ease, taking less than 30 mins each.
Lastly i started to learn some bit manipulation. The concept wasn't hard, at the end of the day I solved four questions, albeit all labeled easy.
Still, my solutions for bit manipulation are often suboptimal. Mainly due to unfamiliarity in utilizing bitwise opertors.

Nothing new for tomorrow. The only goal is to review on backtracking, bit manipulation and hopefully some path finding as well.
