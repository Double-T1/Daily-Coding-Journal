From today onwards, a distinction of 'what i've learned' and 'what i've done' will be made. The goal is to measure the effectiveness of time spent.

What have I learned today:
Xor implemenation on both strings and numbers in an array. 
Bayer-Moore Algo, effectively checking the most repeated number in an array.
Got reminded again not to fall for route dependency.



What did I do:
Started another round of algo and data structure study. Finished five of them today. Not much to say tho, all of them were known topics.
