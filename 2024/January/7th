1. splitting one backend file to two modules
  read this great doc https://www.bennadel.com/blog/2169-where-does-node-js-and-require-look-for-modules.htm
  => not sure if this is the best practice though, given that several external modules were used in different files
2. is it ideal to match backend file construction with the front end?? aside from whether it's feasible or not
